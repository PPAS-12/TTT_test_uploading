# Default Logic behaviour that the AI will fallback on if no other fits the bill
# Should just be "good enough" to make sure the AI acts smart in the war
# Written by Henrik "Groogy" Hansson

#Adjustments
#Default AI (ie neutral AI) will act like a mix between democratic and fascist, but in general way more conservative and mostly interested in obtaining cores and the status quo. If they have enough warscore, they will puppet/liberate neighbors as well.
#Neutral AI in general do not directly annex other nations.
#The plan is to eventually make individualized AI for every country in the game.
